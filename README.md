# Crayons-CSS-project
This project showcased the CSS/HTML toolkit and its ability to create complex images using scripts that implement shadow, color-gradient, 3D effects, etc. 
I learned about using color in CSS by manipulating RGB, HSL and Hex color commands to build a set of markers.
I learned about shadow using box-shadow and blur-radius as well as spread-radius.
I am excited to implement these new tools as I continue my journey through CSS.
